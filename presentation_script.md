## Introduction (Person 1)
"Hello everyone! We're [Team Name], and today we're excited to share our project with you. I'm [Name], and with me are my teammates [Name 2] and [Name 3]. Before we dive in, we'd like to note that what you're about to see is... let's say, an interesting interpretation of a functioning project."
## Opening (Person 1) - 1 minute
"Good [morning/afternoon], judges. We're a team of three students: [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3]. Today we'll walk you through our project, including what worked, what didn't, and what we learned along the way."



## Project Goal & Scope (Person 2) - 2 minutes
"Our project aimed to [specific goal]. We had [X] weeks to complete this, and we focused on three main objectives:
- Primary goal
- Secondary goal
- Learning objective





To be completely transparent, we faced some significant challenges..."



## Technical Implementation (Person 3) - 3 minutes
"Let me show you how we built this:
- Core technology used
- Main components
- Key challenges we solved (and some we didn't)






[Demo the main feature]







You'll notice this part isn't as smooth as we'd like because [honest explanation]. We prioritized [important feature] over polishing this section, given our time constraints."







## Challenges & Learning (Person 1) - 2 minutes
"Let's address the elephant in the room - there are some rough edges in our project:
- We underestimated [specific challenge]
- The data processing is slower than ideal because [technical reason]
- If we had another week, we would have fixed [specific issue]







However, these setbacks taught us valuable lessons about scope management and technical planning."

## Future Improvements (Person 2) - 1 minute
"Given more time, here's what we'd improve:
1. Optimize the [specific feature] performance
2. Implement proper error handling for [specific case]
3. Refactor the [problematic component]"
## Q&A (All)





"We're ready for your questions. We'd especially appreciate your insights on [specific technical challenge] we encountered."

**Team Notes:**
- Keep answers brief and honest
- It's okay to admit what you don't know
- Focus on what you learned from the challenges
- Have your project ready to demo specific parts if asked
- If stuck on a technical question, explain your thought process even if you didn't implement it
